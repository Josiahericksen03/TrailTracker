# Trail Tracker

A web application for managing trail camera footage with AI-powered animal detection and GPS-based camera tracking.

## What It Does

Trail Tracker helps you organize and analyze trail camera data. Upload images and videos from your trail cameras, and the app will automatically extract metadata (camera ID, date, time) and identify animals using AI. You can manage your camera locations on an interactive map, view upload history, and see statistics about your wildlife sightings.

## Features

### üéØ Core Functionality
- **AI Animal Detection**: Identifies Bear, Boar, Bobcat, Deer, Turkey, and Unidentifiable animals using a trained ResNet18 model
- **Metadata Extraction**: Uses OCR to extract camera ID, date, and time from trail camera images
- **Video Processing**: Extracts the 10th frame from videos for analysis
- **Camera Management**: Add camera locations with GPS coordinates and manage them on a map
- **Upload History**: View all your uploads with filtering and editing capabilities

### üó∫Ô∏è Interactive Map
- **GPS Location**: Get your current location coordinates
- **Camera Pins**: See all your camera locations on an interactive map

## How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- MongoDB
- FFmpeg
- Tesseract OCR

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Josiahericksen03/TrailTracker
   cd Trailtracker
   ```

2. **Set up Python environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install system dependencies**
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install mongodb-community ffmpeg tesseract
   
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install mongodb ffmpeg tesseract-ocr
   
   # Windows
   # Download and install MongoDB, FFmpeg, and Tesseract separately
   ```

4. **Start MongoDB**
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew services start mongodb-community
   
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo systemctl start mongod
   
   # Windows
   # Start MongoDB service from Windows Services
   ```

5. **Set up the Backend API**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the backend directory (separate repository)
   cd ../trailtracker-backend
   npm install
   node server.js
   ```
   *Note: The backend runs on port 5001 and handles user authentication and additional API endpoints.*

6. **Start the Flask application**
   ```bash
   # Return to the main project directory
   cd ../Trailtracker
   python app.py
   ```

7. **Access the application**
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`
   - Register a new account or log in with existing credentials
   - Start uploading trail camera footage!

### Configuration

The application uses these default settings:
- **Database**: MongoDB running on localhost:27017
- **Upload folder**: `uploads/` directory in the project
- **AI model**: `animal_model.pth` (43MB trained model)
- **Backend API**: `http://localhost:5001/api`
